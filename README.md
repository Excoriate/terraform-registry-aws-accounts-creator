### Module standard structure
The module's relevant components, structure and "skeleton" is described below:

Where:
* _Module_: refers to the actual module's directory. Where the `.tf` files reside.
* _Examples_: refers to the examples directory, where the examples recipes lives. These are also used for testing the infrastructure using [Terratest](https://terratest.gruntwork.io/).

## Developer Experience
Some tools that this repo uses:
- üß∞ Terraform ‚Äî strongly recommended the latest versions
- üß∞ Go ‚Äî justified mostly for **[Terratest](https://terratest.gruntwork.io/)**
- üß∞ [TaskFile](https://taskfile.dev/#/) ‚Äî for the automation of the tasks.
>**NOTE**: For automation during the development process, I use [precommit](https://pre-commit.com/), which is a framework for managing and maintaining multi-language pre-commit hooks. It's a great tool, and I highly recommend it. All the hooks required are installed by [this](./DevEx/scripts/hooks/install-pre-commit-hooks-deps.sh) script. It's recommended though to run it through the [TaskFile](./TaskFile.yml) task `pre-commit-init`.
```bash
task pre-commit-init
```
### Configuring AWS credentials for local development
For sure you've seen that in the main Taskfile, there's a task called `gen-env-aws`. That task aims to generate a proper `.env.<env>.aws` **dotEnv** file which is used by the `TaskFile.yml` tasks. If you have a proper AWS credentials file, you can run the following command:
```bash
task gen-env-aws
```
In simple terms, that tasks (which runs a shell script) scan your pre-existing AWS profiles, and generate the `.env.<env>.aws` file for you. When it's generated, running a task that wraps a terraform command, will use the generated `.env.<env>.aws` file to set the proper AWS credentials. For example:
```bash
# dev refers to the environment selected, which's how the file is also named. E.g.: env.dev.aws
ENV=dev task module-plan
```

## Module Versioning

This Module follows the principles of [Semantic Versioning (SemVer)].

Given a version number `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, we increment the:

1. `MAJOR` version when we make incompatible changes,
2. `MINOR` version when we add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
3. `PATCH` version when we make backwards compatible bug fixes.

### Backwards compatibility in `0.0.z` and `0.y.z` version

- Backwards compatibility in versions `0.0.z` is **not guaranteed** when `z` is increased. (Initial development)
- Backwards compatibility in versions `0.y.z` is **not guaranteed** when `y` is increased. (Pre-release)
